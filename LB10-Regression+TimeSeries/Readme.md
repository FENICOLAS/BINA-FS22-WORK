## A) Regression

Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of data points. Given a set of data points, we can use a clustering algorithm to classify each data point into a specific group. In theory, data points that are in the same group should **have similar properties and/or features**, while data points in different groups should have highly dissimilar properties and/or features. Clustering is a **method of unsupervised learning** and is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields.

## B) Time Series

Supervised learning learns a function to make prediction of a defined label based on the input data. It can be either **classifying data** into a category (classification problem) or **forecasting an outcome** (regression algorithms). **Classification model** identifies which category an object belongs to whereas **Regression model** predicts a continuous output.

* see [Top 6 Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-machine-learning-algorithms-for-classification-2197870ff501) for an indepth discussion on major machine learning algorithms for classification problems, including: logistic regression, *decision tree*, *random forest*, support vector machine, **k nearest neighbour** and naive bayes.
