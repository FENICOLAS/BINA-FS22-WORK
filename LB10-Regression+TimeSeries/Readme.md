**Regression Analysis** is the study of dependence: how does a response variable change as the values of one or more predictor variables are changed? In statistical modeling, Regression Analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the *outcome* or *response* variable) and one or more independent variables (often called *predictors*, *covariates*, *explanatory variables* or *features*). The most common form of Regression Analysis is *Linear Regression*, in which one finds the *line* (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion. For example, the method of ordinary least squares computes the unique line (or hyperplane) that *minimizes the sum of squared differences* (*residuals*) between the true data and that line (or hyperplane).

* see the [StatQuest Tutorial](https://youtu.be/nk2CQITm_eo) of Josh Starmer from xxxx on the **Linear Regression** technique.

Supervised learning learns a function to make prediction of a defined label based on the input data. It can be either **classifying data** into a category (classification problem) or **forecasting an outcome** (regression algorithms). **Classification model** identifies which category an object belongs to whereas **Regression model** predicts a continuous output.

* see [Top 6 Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-machine-learning-algorithms-for-classification-2197870ff501) for an indepth discussion on major machine learning algorithms for classification problems, including: logistic regression, *decision tree*, *random forest*, support vector machine, **k nearest neighbour** and naive bayes.
