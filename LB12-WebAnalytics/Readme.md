## A) Web Analytics

> *"The importance of a Web page is an inherently sub jective matter, which depends on the
readers interests, knowledge and attitudes. But there is still much that can be said ob jectively
about the relative importance of Web pages."*  
> *Sergey Brin and Larry Page, "The PageRank Citation Ranking: Bringing Order to the Web", 1998*
 
* [The Academic Paper That Started Google](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016975529800110X).  In 1995, Larry Page met Sergey Brin. At the time, Page and Brin were Ph.D students at Stanford University. The two began collaborating on a research project nicknamed “BackRub” with the goal of ranking web pages into a measure of importance by converting their backlink data. Without knowing it at the time, Page and Brin developed the [PageRank algorithm](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf) that became the original Google Search algorithm.
