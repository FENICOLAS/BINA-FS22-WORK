Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
For a brief introduction to the ideas behind the library, you can read the [introductory notes](https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html) or the [paper](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03021).  
You can browse the [example gallery](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html) to see some of the things that you can do with seaborn.

* [**BOKEH** Visualization Library](https://bokeh.org/)

Bokeh is a Python library for creating interactive visualizations for modern web browsers. It helps you build beautiful graphics, ranging from simple plots to complex dashboards with streaming datasets. With Bokeh, you can create JavaScript-powered visualizations without writing any JavaScript yourself.
See the [First Steps Tutorial](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/first_steps.html#first-steps) to quickly learn about the most important features and capabilities of Bokeh.  
Or browse the [gallery](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html) for examples of using Bokeh in different ways.

und weitere aktuelle Tools/Libraries zur Visualisierung mittels Python    
* [DASH/Plotly](https://dash.plotly.com/)   
Downloaded 600,000 times per month, **Dash** is the original low-code framework for rapidly building data apps in Python, R, Julia, and F# (experimental). Written on top of **Plotly.js** and **React.js**, Dash is ideal for building and deploying data apps with customized user interfaces. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data. Through a couple of simple patterns, Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols that are required to build a full-stack web app with interactive data visualization. Dash is simple enough that you can bind a user interface to your code in less than 10 minutes. Dash apps are rendered in the web browser. You can deploy your apps to VMs or Kubernetes clusters and then share them through URLs. Since Dash apps are viewed in the web browser, Dash is inherently cross-platform and mobile ready.

* [STREAMLIT](https://streamlit.io/)  
**Streamlit** is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. In just a few minutes you can build and deploy powerful data apps.  
**Streamlit Cloud** is a workspace for you and your team to easily deploy, manage, and collaborate on your Streamlit apps. If you're just getting started and have not yet built your first Streamlit app, check out the main [Get started page](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started) first. When you're ready to share it, create a Streamlit Cloud account and you can launch your app in just a few minutes!
