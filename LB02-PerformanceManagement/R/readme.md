**ggplot2** is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on [The Grammar of Graphics](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html). You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details. ggplot2 is a **R package** dedicated to data visualization. It can greatly improve the quality and aesthetics of your graphics, and will make you much more efficient in creating them.
You can browse the [R-Graph Gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html) a page which is dedicated to general ggplot2 tips that you can apply to any chart, like customizing a title, adding annotation, or using faceting.

Bokeh is a Python library for creating interactive visualizations for modern web browsers. It helps you build beautiful graphics, ranging from simple plots to complex dashboards with streaming datasets. With Bokeh, you can create JavaScript-powered visualizations without writing any JavaScript yourself.
See the [First Steps Tutorial](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/first_steps.html#first-steps) to quickly learn about the most important features and capabilities of Bokeh.  
Or browse the [gallery](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html) for examples of using Bokeh in different ways.

Und weitere aktuelle Tools/Libraries zur Visualisierung, zu Dashboards, zu graphical User Interfaces mittels Python    
+ [DASH/Plotly](https://dash.plotly.com/)   
Downloaded 600,000 times per month, **Dash** is the original low-code framework for rapidly building data apps in Python, R, Julia, and F# (experimental). Written on top of **Plotly.js** and **React.js**, Dash is ideal for building and deploying data apps with customized user interfaces. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data. Through a couple of simple patterns, Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols that are required to build a full-stack web app with interactive data visualization. Dash is simple enough that you can bind a user interface to your code in less than 10 minutes. Dash apps are rendered in the web browser. You can deploy your apps to VMs or Kubernetes clusters and then share them through URLs. Since Dash apps are viewed in the web browser, Dash is inherently cross-platform and mobile ready.
