## A) Relational Data Model

Im Vorwort zu seinem Standardwerk *The RELATIONAL MODEL for DATABASE MANAGEMENT* schreibt [Edgar F. Codd](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd) "In developing the relational model, I have tried to follow Einstein's advice, *Make it as simple as possible, but no simpler." 

The relational model (RM) for database management is an approach to managing data using a **structure and language** consistent with **first-order predicate logic**, first described in 1969 by English computer scientist Edgar F. Codd, where all data is represented in terms of **tuples**, grouped into **relations**. 
A database organized in terms of the relational model is a relational database (RDB). Corresponding an system to handle a relational database is called a relational database management system (RDBMS). 
The purpose of the relational model is to provide a declarative method for specifying **data and queries**: users directly state what information the database contains and what information they want from it, and let the database management system (DBMS) take care of describing data structures for storing the data and retrieval procedures for answering queries. Most relational database management system use the **SQL** data definition and query language.
