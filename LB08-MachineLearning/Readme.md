* The course [Machine Learning CS229 at Stanford](https://cs229.stanford.edu/) is one of the most popular machine learning courses created by **Andrew Ng, co-founder of Coursera** and founder of deeplearning.ai. There is a free variant available at [Coursera](https://de.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), given by Andrew Ng himself.
> *Fantastic intro to the fundamentals of machine learning. If you want to take your understanding of machine learning concepts beyond "model.fit(X, Y), model.predict(X)" then this is the course for you. (David W.)*

* [Machine Learning - An online comic from Google AI](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1). **A comic strip** approach to machine learning? Could it possibly work? The hero is a cat, so of course it can. Have fun. 
There is also a free [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) at Google  

* On [edX](https://www.edx.org/learn/machine-learning) you'll also find a lot of well done and free online courses for Machine Learning and related topics. Note **edX** was started in 2012 by Professor Anant Agarwal and colleagues from MIT and Harvard as a platform that would offer their courses online, open to any person up to the challenge, for free.

* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.  Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.Is was initiated in 2009 and in the field of computer sciences and mathematics.. Note: scikit-learn has received a [prize for open-source scientific software from the French Government](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/remise-des-prix-science-ouverte-du-logiciel-libre-de-la-recherche/) in february 2022. This is great recognition for all the community of contributors and users of a project born in France.  

* [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) - An Open Source Framework for Crawling Websites and Extracting Structured Data (Scraping). See the [Towards Data Science Blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-scrapy-to-build-your-own-dataset-64ea2d7d4673) on Using Scrapy to Build your Own Dataset

* [Webscraper.io](https://webscraper.io/) - A free Chrome Extension. See the [Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/n7fob_XVsbY) on using the webscraper to scrape a simple ecommerce site
