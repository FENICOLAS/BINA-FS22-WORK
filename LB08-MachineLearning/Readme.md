* The course [Machine Learning CS229 at Stanford](https://cs229.stanford.edu/) is one of the most popular machine learning courses created by **Andrew Ng, co-founder of Coursera** and founder of deeplearning.ai. There is a free variant available at [Coursera](https://de.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), given by Andrew Ng himself.
> *Fantastic intro to the fundamentals of machine learning. If you want to take your understanding of machine learning concepts beyond "model.fit(X, Y), model.predict(X)" then this is the course for you. (David W.)*

* [Machine Learning - An online comic from Google AI](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai/ml-comic-1). **A comic strip** approach to machine learning? Could it possibly work? The hero is a cat, so of course it can. Have fun. 
There is also a free [Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) at Google  

* On [edX](https://www.edx.org/learn/machine-learning) you'll also find a lot of well done and free online courses for Machine Learning and related topics. Note **edX** was started in 2012 by Professor Anant Agarwal and colleagues from MIT and Harvard as a platform that would offer their courses online, open to any person up to the challenge, for free.

* [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) - A Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. See in the Blog [How open source software is fighting COVID-19](https://blog.tidelift.com/how-open-source-software-is-fighting-covid-19) the *DXY-COVID-19-Crawler* of BlankerL that was created in January 2020 and is one of the earliest responses from the open source community to COVID-19. When the virus was spreading primarily in China, the Chinese medical community was using a site called DXY.cn to report and track cases. To make the information more readily available and usable by others, GitHub user BlankerL wrote a web crawler to systematically collect data from the DXY.cn site and make it available via an API and data warehouse. 

* [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) - An Open Source Framework for Crawling Websites and Extracting Structured Data (Scraping). See the [Towards Data Science Blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/using-scrapy-to-build-your-own-dataset-64ea2d7d4673) on Using Scrapy to Build your Own Dataset

* [Webscraper.io](https://webscraper.io/) - A free Chrome Extension. See the [Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/n7fob_XVsbY) on using the webscraper to scrape a simple ecommerce site
