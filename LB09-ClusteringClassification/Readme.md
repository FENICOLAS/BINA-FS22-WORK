* The course [XXXXX](https://cs229.stanford.edu/) is one of the most popular machine learning courses created by **Andrew Ng, co-founder of Coursera** and founder of deeplearning.ai. There is a free variant available at [Coursera](https://de.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), given by Andrew Ng himself.
> *Fantastic intro to the fundamentals of machine learning. If you want to take your understanding of machine learning concepts beyond "model.fit(X, Y), model.predict(X)" then this is the course for you. (David W.)*

## C) Tools and Examples

* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.  Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.Is was initiated in 2009 and in the field of computer sciences and mathematics.. Note: scikit-learn has received a [prize for open-source scientific software from the French Government](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/remise-des-prix-science-ouverte-du-logiciel-libre-de-la-recherche/) in february 2022. This is great recognition for all the community of contributors and users of a project born in France.  

* The [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/) is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. The tidyverse collection was initiated by Hadley Wickham an Assistant Professor at Rice University and an active memberof the R community. See the free online version of his excellent book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) on how to do data science with R

* For [KNIME](https://www.knime.com/), you'll find a lot of well curated video tutorials, e.g. [Behind the Scenes of Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/XtOmoIibsGk). See also the excellent book of Rosaria Silipo, Principal Data Scientist and Head of Evangelism at KNIME AG, [Guide to Intelligent Data Science](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-45574-3)
