Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of data points. Given a set of data points, we can use a clustering algorithm to classify each data point into a specific group. In theory, data points that are in the same group should **have similar properties and/or features**, while data points in different groups should have highly dissimilar properties and/or features. Clustering is a **method of unsupervised learning** and is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields.
